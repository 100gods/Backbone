# Backbone.Marionette.js: A Gentle Introduction

This code repository is the companion to my [book on Marionette.js](https://leanpub.com/marionette-gentle-introduction). You can see the app live here: [http://davidsulc.github.io/marionette-gentle-introduction](http://davidsulc.github.io/marionette-gentle-introduction)

Even if you don't have the book, you can learn a lot from looking through the commit history. But if you're serious about wanting to become competent with Marionette.js, I suggest you consider purchasing the book: typical mistakes and various tips and techniques are indicated in the book and absent from this repository.

If you're interested, you can view a sample of the book at https://leanpub.com/marionette-gentle-introduction
